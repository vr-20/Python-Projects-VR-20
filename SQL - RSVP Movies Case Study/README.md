PROBLEM STATEMENT

RSVP Movies is an Indian film production company which has produced many super-hit movies. They have usually released movies for the Indian audience but for their next project, 
they are planning to release a movie for the global audience in 2022.

The production company wants to plan their every move analytically based on the data. We have been provided with the data of the movies that have been released in the past three 
years. We have to analyze the data set and draw meaningful insights that can help them start their new project.
