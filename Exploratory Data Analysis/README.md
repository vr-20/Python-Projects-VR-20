PROBLEM STATEMENT

This case study aims to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their instalments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

In other words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e., the variables which are strong indicators of defaulters. The company can utilize this knowledge or analysis for its portfolio and risk assessment.

When the company receives a loan application, the company has to decide for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank's decision:

If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company.

If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e., applicant is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.
